I am currently a PhD student at Syracuse University, where I conduct research in the SYNE Lab under the supervision of Professor Endadul Hoque. My research interests lie at the intersection of software testing and security, with a particular focus on fuzzing, network protocols, compiler infrastructures such as LLVM, and parser development.

I received a Bachelor’s degree with distinction from Syrracuse University in 2024.
